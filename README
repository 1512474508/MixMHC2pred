############
INSTALLATION
############

1) Download MixMHC2pred-1.0.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip MixMHC2pred-1.0.zip in this directory.

3) To test your installation, make sure you are in MixMHC2pred-1.0/ directory
  and run the following command, depending on your operating system:

  - Mac OS:   ./MixMHC2pred -i test/testData.txt -o test/out.txt -a DRB1_11_01 DRB3_02_02 DPA1_01_03__DPB1_04_01 DQA1_05_05__DQB1_03_01

  - Windows:   MixMHC2pred.exe -i test/testData.txt -o test/out.txt -a DRB1_11_01 DRB3_02_02 DPA1_01_03__DPB1_04_01 DQA1_05_05__DQB1_03_01

Your file out.txt should be the same as test/out_compare.txt.
Running the software should take only a few seconds.
The testData.txt file corresponds to HLA-II peptidomics data obtained from the cell
line CD165 for our study.

######
- Do not use spaces in your file or directory names.
- Do not use other special characters (e.g., *, ?, %, &,...) in file or directory names.


4) (Optional) To run MixMHC2pred from anywhere on your computer, make an alias of the
MixMHC2pred executable (see above for which one depending on operating system) or put it
to your path.

Command:
MixMHC2pred -i input_file -o output_file -a allele1 allele2 

* Input file (command: -i or --input):
File listing all the peptides with one peptide per line. It can also be a fasta
file (lines starting with ">" are skipped).

* Output file (command: -o or --output
The name of the output file (including the directory). Peptides are kept in the order
from the input file. Peptides shorter than 12 amino acids or containing non-standard
amino acids are kept but with a score of "nan".

* Alleles (command: -a or --alleles):
List of HLA-II alleles to test. Use the nomenclature DRB1_03_01 for HLA-DRB1*03:01 or
DPA1_01_03__DPB1_04_01 for HLA-DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:01 for example. The full list of
alleles available and corresponding nomenclature is given in the file Alleles_list.txt.

If you want to make predictions with multiple alleles, list the different alleles separated
by a space (e.g. -a DRB1_11_01 DRB3_02_02). Only the score from the best allele for each
peptide is returned.


Other optional arguments
* --no_Nterm and/or --no_Cterm:
When these switches are used (not recommended), the N- and/or C-terminal motifs are not
included in the computations of the score of each peptide.

* --flat_ws:
MixMHC2pred uses binding core offset preferences when computing the score from each
peptide. It is nevertheless possible (but not recommended) to turn this feature off
with this switch (the binding score is then summed over all possible offsets).


#################
OTHER INFORMATION
#################

- MixMHC2pred is meant for scoring different peptides and prioritising
  the most likely HLA-II ligands. As it is trained on naturally presented
  peptides, it does not output a predicted affinity value, simply a score.

- The score is computed for each allele provided in input, and the maximal score
  is used to determine the most likely allele (column 2).

- The Score returned (column 3) corresponds to a percentile rank (best score is
  0, worst score is 100). This tells among random peptides, the percent of peptides
  expected to be better binders to this allele than the given peptide. This score
  is computed such that the top 1% best random peptides will have a length
  distribution following the one observed in naturally presented peptides.

- The Score_perL (column 4) is similar but computed based only on peptides having
  the same length. This score thus doesn't follow the length distribution observed
  in naturally presented ligands.

- The BestCore and Best_s returned correspond to the most likely binding core
  offset for the given peptide towards its best allele.
  
- The list of alleles available is provided in Alleles_list.txt showing the
  HLA-nomenclature and the corresponding nomenclature to use when running MixMHC2pred.
